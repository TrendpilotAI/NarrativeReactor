## Learnings & Notes
- Use markdown formatting for clean output
- Each Part should be self-contained but narratively connected
- Cinematic scripts need: SETTING, CAMERA, LIGHTING, SOUND, ACTION, DIALOGUE
- Include AI generation prompts for character consistency
- Tables work well for specifications and schedules
- Code blocks for interface mockups and prompts
- Signature pieces (3.1 and 6.1) need extra detail and ★ markers
