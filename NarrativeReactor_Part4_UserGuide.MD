TWITTER (280 char):
"AI isn't replacing advisors. It's giving them back 20 hours a week.

That's 20 hours for what only humans can do: understand, connect, guide.

The future of work is AI enabling humans to be more human.

#FutureOfWork #DecisionVelocity"

LINKEDIN (1,847 char):
"Everyone asks if AI is going to replace knowledge workers.

That's the wrong question.

The right question is: What happens when knowledge workers have AI that actually works WITH them?

[Full thought leadership piece...]"

THREADS (423 char):
"Quick thought on the future of work debate...

We keep asking "will AI replace us?"

But the advisors using Signal Studio aren't being replaced—they're finally doing the work they signed up for.

Less midnight research sessions. More actual client conversations.

That's the future I'm excited about 💙"
